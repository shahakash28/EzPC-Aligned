# CrypTFlow: An End-to-end System for Secure TensorFlow Inference [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/mpc-msri/EzPC/issues) [![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/mpc-msri/EzPC.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.io/mpc-msri/EzPC)

This repository is a copy of EzPC repository \[[mpc-msri/EzPC](https://github.com/mpc-msri/EzPC)\]. This copy fixes errors that occurs due to unaligned alloc, so that EzPC/SCI can be used as a sub-repository in building other projects.

## Introduction
This repository has the following components:  

- **EzPC**: a language for secure machine learning.
- **Athos** (part of **CrypTFlow**): an end-to-end compiler from TensorFlow to a variety of semi-honest MPC protocols. Athos leverages EzPC as a low-level intermediate language.
- **Porthos** (part of **CrypTFlow**): a semi-honest 3 party computation protocol which is geared towards TensorFlow-like applications.
- **Aramis** (part of **CrypTFlow**): a novel technique that uses hardware with integrity guarantees to convert any semi-honest MPC protocol into an MPC protocol that provides malicious security.
- **SCI** (part of **CrypTFlow2**): a semi-honest 2-party computation library for secure inference on deep neural networks.

Each one of the above is independent and usable in their own right and more information can be found in the readme of each of the components. But together these combine to make **CrypTFlow** a powerful system for end-to-end secure inference of deep neural networks written in TensorFlow.

With these components in place, we are able to run for the first time secure inference on the [ImageNet dataset]([http://www.image-net.org) with the pre-trained models of the following deep neural nets: ResNet-50, DenseNet-121 and SqueezeNet for ImageNet.

For setup instructions, please refer to each of the components' readme. We plan to release a docker version of the system as well which will make the system easier to setup.
